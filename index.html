					<i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> What is missing in your diet?
				</h2>
				<p>
					You need 13 vitamins in order to live, and though you can
					actually get most of them from eating a variety of meats,
					you're going to miss out on some crucial ones if you totally
					forego flora. Folate, along with vitamins C and E, pretty
					much only come from veggies, mostly green leafy ones and
					citrus. This is why sailors used to get scurvy—not enough
					vitamin C in their largely fish- and other-meat-based diets.
					Plus, if you don't get enough vitamin E your body can't use
					vitamin K as well, so even though you're getting enough from
					fish, liver, and beef you won't actually be able to make use
					of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					And then there’s the issue of fiber. Meat has no fiber, yet
					we know that fiber is crucial to a healthy diet. It promotes
					a diverse, robust microbiome in your intestines, and your
					microbiome seems to impact everything from your basic
					digestion to your immune system to your mood. You need
					fiber, and meat can’t give it to you.

				<h2>
					<i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Fruits, Vegetables and Legumes
				</h2>
				<p>
					Diets high in fruits and vegetables are widely recommended
					for their health-promoting properties. Fruits and vegetables
					have historically held a place in dietary guidance because
					of their concentrations of vitamins, especially vitamins C
					and A; minerals, especially electrolytes; and more recently
					phytochemicals, especially antioxidants. Additionally,
					fruits and vegetables are recommended as a source of dietary
					fiber.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fruits and vegetables are universally promoted as healthy.
					The Dietary Guidelines recommend you make one-half of your
					plate fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables include a
					diverse group of plant foods that vary greatly in content of
					energy and nutrients. Additionally, fruits and vegetables
					supply dietary fiber, and fiber intake is linked to lower
					incidence of cardiovascular disease and obesity. Fruits and
					vegetables also supply vitamins and minerals to the diet and
					are sources of phytochemicals that function as antioxidants,
					phytoestrogens, and antiinflammatory agents and through
					other protective mechanisms.

				<h2>
					<i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> 46% adults under 40 are
					suffering from type 2 diabetes
				</h2>
				<p>
					Type 2 diabetes is usually more commonly seen in middle-age
					or older adults. But with the rise of obesity in children,
					it is now also being diagnosed in young people, in
					particular among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth
					and children with non-European backgrounds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Type 2 diabetes can lead to long-term diabetes-related
					complications such as heart and kidney disease. With more
					young people developing type 2 diabetes, diabetes-related
					complications are likely to occur at a younger age. Proper
					treatment is, therefore, essential for preventing long-term
					health problems.
